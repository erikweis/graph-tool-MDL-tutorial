# graph-tool-MDL-tutorial

This repository is a brief, incomplete, and opinionated introduction to the minimum description length (MDL) principle and the graph-tool library.

This code included in this tutorial is largely redundant.
The notebook `gt-basics.ipynb` covers how to create and manipulate graphs in `graph-tool`, but this notbeook is an incomplete duplication of the [graph-tool quickstart guide](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/quickstart.html).
A second notebook, `gt-statistical-inference.ipynb`, covers how to use graph-tool for statistical inference, which is essentially an editorialized version of the [graph-tool cookbook](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/cookbook.html).
Thus, these should be considered as supplementary material to the official documentation, not replacements.
